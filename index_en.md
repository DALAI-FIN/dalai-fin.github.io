      <p>
        Mastering a language is more than learning words: it’s gaining the ability to participate,
        connect, and belong. The tools developed at DALAI-FIN help you strengthen your Finnish skills
        through personalized, AI-powered learning paths, so you can engage confidently in everyday life,
        work, and civic conversations.
