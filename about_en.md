# We develop research‑backed tools to take your language skills to the next level

The DALAI‑FIN Research Project aims to revolutionize and democratize second‑language teaching and learning for adult immigrants.  
The target audience is learners who already have basic Finnish or Swedish skills, and require greater proficiency to:

- gain employment,
- support fluent communication at work, or
- participate fully in the social, cultural, and political life in Finland.

DALAI-FIN develops a state‑of‑the‑art, AI‑assisted language‑learning ecosystem, in collaboration with Finnish and Swedish learners and teachers.
