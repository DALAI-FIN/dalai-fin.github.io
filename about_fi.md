# We develop research‑backed tools to take your language skills to the next level

DALAI‑FIN is a research project aiming to revolutionize adult second‑language teaching and learning 
for migrants who already have basic Finnish or Swedish skills, but require greater proficiency:

- to become employed,
- to support fluent communication at work, or
- to participate fully in the social, cultural, and political life in Finland.

Over the course of this project, we are developing a state‑of‑the‑art, AI‑boosted, research‑backed 
language‑learning ecosystem together with Finnish and Swedish learners and teachers.
