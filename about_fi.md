  <h1>We develop research‑backed tools to take your language skills to the next level</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    DALAI‑FIN is a research project aiming to revolutionize adult second‑language teaching and learning 
    for migrants who already have basic Finnish or Swedish skills, but require greater proficiency to:

  <ul class="about-hero-list">
    <li>become employed,</li>
    <li>support fluent communication at work, or</li>
    <li>participate fully in the social, cultural, and political life in Finland.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over the course of this project, we are developing a state‑of‑the‑art, AI‑boosted, research‑backed 
    language‑learning ecosystem together with Finnish and Swedish learners and teachers.
